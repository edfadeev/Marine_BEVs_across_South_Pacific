### Abstract:
Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) are spherical membrane-bound structures released by bacterial cells that can carry various biological compounds. Experimental investigation of BEVs in marine bacteria, largely limited to laboratory model systems, have suggested putative roles in bacterial ecophysiology. Yet the functions of BEVs in their ecological context has never been explored directly in the ocean. Here we report the results a large-scale oceanographic survey of marine BEVs in surface waters, conducted over more than 5,000 nautical miles in the South Pacific, linking their protein cargoes to the bacterial communities producing them. The presence of marine BEVs was consistently observed across a range of biogeochemical conditions, with an overall abundance comparable to that of bacterial cells (ca. 10<sup>8</sup> BEVs L<sup>-1</sup>). The protein cargoes of marine BEVs differed significantly between environmental conditions, being enriched in carbohydrate transporters and hydrolytic enzymes under phytoplankton bloom conditions, and enriched in iron uptake-related proteins in nutrient-limited waters, suggesting key extracellular functions they could perform in marine bacterial communities. Our observations highlight the ubiquity of marine BEVs and their potential functions across oceanic scales, with implications for our general understanding of key processes in marine microbial ecology.
